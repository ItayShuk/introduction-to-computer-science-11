==================

Tree building functions, using recursive methods,
Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house,
had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams;
for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence
of this continent,compelled into an æsthetic contemplation
he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the
last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.

Didnt add any methods to Node or Record,
although it could have been smart to add, 'is_leaf'

Tried to use recursion as much as I could
